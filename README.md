# ai tests

Over the summer I wanted to refresh myself on the AI I learned during my CS Bachelor's, cover other areas like RL, and get comfortable with PyTorch/other libraries. This repo is a result of that, and some other times when I thought to experiment with AI.

Note that this isn't meant to be a completed implementation of anything, just some quick experiments.
